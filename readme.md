# Puglia Tourist Agent
Puglia Tourist Agent is a Telegram booking bot developed during the hackathon [Opentusk 2024](https://dati.puglia.it/web/guest/hackathon-opentusk-2024).
The purpose of this bot is to make booking easier for tourists visiting our beautiful region.

## The bot
You can find the bot at the following URL: [Puglia Tourist Agent](https://t.me/Prenotazioni_opentusk_2024_bot)

The bot will not respond to your commands because it runs locally but if we decide to implement the project it will be managed by a remote server.

This is what you see when you visit the bot:

### Booking
This command asks for user info to book an event or a service. For now the bot does not communicate to an external website but if we decide to develop the project it will allow you to do so.

### Tourist agent
This command allows the user to search for the closest beach resort or restaurant.
To do so you need to activate the GPS and provide the bot your location.
